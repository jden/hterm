# hterm
google made this, i'm just pushing it to npm.

this is in a really rough form and I'll come back and clean it up later.

ymmv

license:
google owns it, i guess
the source headers say it's BSD

## note
this isn't really using commonjs, so it just exposes a thing called `hterm` as a global.
see also "embed.md"
